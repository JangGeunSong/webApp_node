This repository is for notice board making repository using the node js by server side and other tools.

Server side is node js. At first time I use the vanilla jacascript and vanilla raw node js. but in this month I will add the express or any other server side tool will use.

Server side data base uses MongoDB install via yarn.
MongoDB has the post data ==> title, writer, date, hit, and post number

Front end side also use the other frame work.

Now add the input form then this project end.

Front-end branch --> react part will add
