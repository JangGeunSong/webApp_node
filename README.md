This branch is make the master branch application to the react + next.js

I make almost stuff just add the event listener to the application then done.

After that, I will jump to the angular or vue.js front end frame work practice by doing this project.

server side maybe use PHP because the server side web application PHP is most using the server side language.

Add the event for the component and for the convinence change the some component as class
