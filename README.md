This repository is for notice board making repository using the node js by server side and other tools.

Server side is node js. At first time I use the vanilla jacascript and vanilla raw node js. but in this month I will add the express or any other server side tool will use.

Server side data base uses MongoDB install via yarn.
MongoDB has the post data ==> title, writer, date, hit, and post number

Front end side also use the other frame work.

Now add the input form then this project end.

Front-end branch --> react part will add //added at 4/1

It needs to server side go to node.js framework next.js // 4/3 added.

4/4 ---> react + next.js is almost done. now rest of thing is add the DB and event listener.

4/5 ---> Add the event listener and change some component to class
 Add the banner to header component. 

move the next front-end framework this time.

4/8 ---> Renew the react + next.js branch combind Express and MongoDB for using database display post list.

4/9 ---> some changes react branch

4/10 ---> I will check briefly some technique link to DB another repo and comeback.

This repo will be rebuild. REST API will learn and clone something  -> web applications
